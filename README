UNIVERSAL::can
--------------

Version 1.16, Thu Jan 14 22:54:46 UTC 2010


This module attempts to work around people calling UNIVERSAL::can() as a
function, which it is not.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

    $ perl Build.PL
    $ perl ./Build
    $ perl ./Build test
    $ sudo perl ./Build install

There is also a Makefile.PL, but I don't use it.
