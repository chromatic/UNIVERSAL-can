UNIVERSAL::can
--------------

Version 1.00, Sun Jul  3 21:37:12 UTC 2005

This module attempts to work around people calling UNIVERSAL::can() as a
function, which it is not.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Build.PL
    ./Build
    ./Build test
    ./Build install

There is also a Makefile.PL, but I don't use it.
