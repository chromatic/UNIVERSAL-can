UNIVERSAL::can
--------------

Version 1.11, Fri Feb 10 02:00:38 UTC 2006

This module attempts to work around people calling UNIVERSAL::can() as a
function, which it is not.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Build.PL
    perl ./Build
    perl ./Build test
    perl ./Build install

There is also a Makefile.PL, but I don't use it.
